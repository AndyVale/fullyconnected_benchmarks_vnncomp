# <a href = 'https://github.com/VNNLIB/Benchmarks'>drones_1d_hovering</a>

This benchmark is related to the problem of drone control, using Reinforcement Learning.

This benchmark is taken from the paper _Evaluating Reachability Algorithms for Neural Networks in NeVer2_ presented at [RCRA Workshop 2022](https://rcra2022.wordpress.com/) and is a baseline case study where the output control is a single value for the RPM of all motors in order to take off and hover at a fixed position.
