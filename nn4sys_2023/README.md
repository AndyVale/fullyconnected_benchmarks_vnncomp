# <a href="https://github.com/Khoury-srg/VNNComp23_NN4Sys">Characterizing Neural Network Verification for Systems with NN4SysBench</a>

**Proposed by the α,β-CROWN team in collaboration with Cheng Tan and Haoyu He at Northeastern University.**

**Application:** The benchmark contains networks for database learned index and learned cardinality estimation, which map input from various dimensions to a single scalar output.
