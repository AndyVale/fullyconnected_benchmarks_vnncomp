# Reinforcement Learning

This set of benchmarks is related to classical reinforcement learning problems.

## _Cartpole_

This benchmark is the standard inverted pendulum that must be stabilized

## _Dubins Rejoin_

This benchmark is the problem of making an unmanned aerial vehicle to follow a manned one acting as the lead

## _Lunar Lander_

This benchmark is the rocket trajectory optimization for landing correctly in a given place a two-motor aerial vehicle
