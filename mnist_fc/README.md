This directory contains fully connected networks trained on the MNIST dataset, "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database". The MNIST database is widely used for training image processing systems due to its extensive collection of handwritten digits. All of these networks are part of the VNNCOMP22 benchmarks and are of the fully connected type.
